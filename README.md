# Project: Sudoku-Server

Project Sudoku-Server provides services to help solve Sudoku puzzles.

Sudoku-Server uses Sudoku-Lib to service queries.

## Usage

1. Pre-requisites:

    Software:
      
    ```text
    Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)).
    Gcc version 11.3.0.
    Open JDK version 19.0.2.
    Tomcat or similar Servlet container.
    ```
    
    Develop
    
    ```text
    SWIG 4.1 JNI STUBs from Sudoku-Lib.
    ```
    
2. Build:

    Navigate to project home directory and execute the following commands

    ```bash
    cd $projectDir
    ./gradlew clean
    ./gradlew build
    ```
    
3. Helper Script

    There are helper scripts in the $projectDir/bin directory
    
    ```text
    projectDir/bin/c:  compile clean, build and generate javadoc.
    ```

4. Service:

    The servlet exposes two URLs
    
    ```text
    https://www.<domain>.com/sudoku/server/game/solution
    ```  
    and 
    
    ```text
    https://www.<domain>.com/sudoku/server/game/moves
    ``` 

    The game position to be analysed is supplied via parameter 'in_position' as in the following:
    
    ```text
    https://www.<domain>.com/sudoku/server/game/solution?in_position=0 6 5 2 0 9 3 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 6 0 4 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 5 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0
    ``` 
    
    The parameter is a composed of all 81 game cell values ordered by row.
    
    The server then returns xml contaiining either,
    
        1. a solved board for the 'solution' endpoint.
        
        2. a set of possible next moves for the 'moves' endpoint.
        
    There are two additional url flags which can be used
    
    ```text
    xml=[y|n] can be used to toggle output between html (default) and xml.
    ```
    
    ```text
    pretty=[y|n] can be used to toggle pretty-printing of xml.
    ```
